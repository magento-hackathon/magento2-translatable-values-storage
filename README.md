# Translation storage

adds a storage layer in the database to contain all translatable values.
- translatable strings
- product attribute values
- category attribute values
- static blocks
- cms pages

Please note this is a proof of concept that, right now, only has the DB table.

In the end this should offer a simple way to connect all translateble values in Magento to a translation platform like
crowdin, oneskyapp, transifax or even just Excel
